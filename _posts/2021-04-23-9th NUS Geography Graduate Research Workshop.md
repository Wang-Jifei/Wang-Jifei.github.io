### Research Topic

#### Investigating the Effects of Landscape Structure and Urban Function on the Urban Heat Island Phenomenon Using 3D GIS and RS Techniques

**Abstract:** The rapid urbanization forms complex urban systems with different levels of aggregation patterns from social and physical perspectives and led to a series of environmental problems. The existing research mainly focuses on the changes of urban morphological properties to understand the relationships between UHI effects and land cover/land use (LULC). However, few studies link the 3D morphological factors and human activities with urban thermal environment and LST variation. Under the context of urban studies and landscape ecology, this study is proposed to extend current research on urban structure and UHI effects by incorporating cutting edge algorithms (e.g., Machine learning, Deep learning) in GIS and Remote Sensing fields. This study aims to solve the problems of analyzing Land Surface Temperature (LST) variation using 2D/3D morphological factors and human mobility features derived from urban landscape compositions and urban social-economic activities in large cities.
