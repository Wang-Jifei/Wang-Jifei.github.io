# The Restoration of Critically Endangered Swamp Cypress Trees in Laos
## Abstract
Glyptostrobus pensilis or Asian Swamp Cypress is a critically endangered conifer species, with remaining trees in the wild found mostly in Laos. It is important to study this species as surveys have shown that 400-1000 trees have been felled in the last ~50 years, and only less than 400 trees remain globally (Coffman, 2015). Glyptostrobus is also dubbed as a “living fossil” due to its great significance in the other fields of study like paleoclimate, paleoecology and geology.  

In this paper, we examined ecological, environmental and dendrochronology data collected from Glyptostrobus stands in Nakai-Nam Theun (NNT) National Park in Laos from 2015-2020. We performed Geodetector and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) analyses to investigate spatial variability of trees relative to soil moisture and elevation. Dendrochronological techniques were applied to investigate historical ecological patterns and give insight into factors controlling juvenile growth for critical for determining the most suitable conditions for propagation and transplanting. We determined that elevation and soil moisture had a major control over Glyptostrobus’ Diameter at Breast Height (DBH)  and tree height. Glyptostrobus trees prefer soil moisture values from 30-50 VMC%; taller Glyptostrobus were generally found in higher elevations (~800 m); and Glyptostrobus with higher DBH were found in both medium-high elevations (~600 and ~800m) with soil moisture values of 30-50 VMC%. Inherent difficulties in dating tropical trees prevented significant progress in developing a chronology in the timeframe of this project. We applied the statistical treatments of power transformation and modified negative exponential standardisation but was left with a high remnant variance which indicated the necessity for further work in cross-dating the Glyptostrobus samples.

We explored the variance through a wavelet analysis to establish a preliminary understanding for future cross-dating efforts. Additionally, we explored juvenile growth patterns. Preliminary analysis supported the hypothesis of Glyptostrobus requiring high light conditions during initial growth. Furthermore, we were able to identify possible recruitment events within the time-series, each indicating greater ring widths at the initial stage of Glyptostrobus growth. We also mapped the distribution of soil moisture and soil pH around villages in Laos.

We discovered that there are large spatial variations in soil moisture within stands, which can possibly be attributed changes in the flow of rivers or the local water table; we hypothesised that areas with higher soil moisture can be attributed to proximity to streams. We then performed habitat suitability modelling to determine the locations of highly suitable Glyptostrobus habitats in the NNT National Park under current (2020) and future climate scenarios (2021-2040), and quantified the change in habitat suitability between these time periods. The southeast corner of the NNT National Park generally showed an increase in habitat suitability, whereas the northwest corner showed a decrease.

Finally, we proposed a conceptual restoration plan, including critical next step recommendations for nurseries and transplanting experiments. We also provided recommendations for further research and long-term steps plans for propagation and restoration of Glyptostrobus in the NNT National Park.
