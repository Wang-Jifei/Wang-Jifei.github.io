##ABSTRACT 

The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia is the most serious global issue in 2020, causing enormous impacts on various aspects
of human society from public health to economic growth. The ecological environment has also been affected due to the transformation of
human activities during the epidemic period. The implementation of the ‘Lockdown’ and ‘Stay-in-Home’ policies have reduced the pollution
emissions from transport and commercial areas, thus altered the urban environment. Based on the analysis of the temporal and spatial
distribution of the COVID-19, we studied the changes of the air and thermal environment in Wuhan City and New York City in 2020.
Combining spatial interpolation and spatial clustering analysis, we further analyzed the dynamics of air pollution and urban heat
island effect to evaluate environmental variations.
